# Gadget_Shop

This project is purely based on core java concepts such as oops concepts, collection framework, recursion & detailed information are mentioned below :-

# 1.  Inheritance:-
 It is used to inherits common properties from particular gadegts category
such as in mobile concepts all types of mobile are having some common properties which are included in all the mobile so writing same lines of code repitetive we use inheritance concept to 
inherits those properites.

# 2. Encapsulation:-
The process of binding state and behaviours of an object together is known as Encapsulation.
It is used to achieve data hiding

# 3.Polymorphism:-
Ability of an object to exhibits more than one form is known as polymorphism 

# 4. Abstraction:- 
The process of displaying the things which are required and hiding the things which are not reuired is known as Abstraction.

# Method Overloading:- 
Class is having more than one method with same but different formal arguments Either differening length or differening data type.

# Method Overriding:-
Sub class non-static overrides superclass non-static method is known as method overriding.
Subclass and Superclass is having non-static method with the same name and same formal argument is known as method overriding. 

# Method :-
It is a block of statement used to perform specific task
Method have return type of data
Method name can be anything
Method can be executed in 3 ways with directly, by using class name, object reference.

1. No Argument Method:-  The method which does not have any formal argument is called as No Argument Method.
2. Parameterized Method:- The mehod which has formal arguments is called as paramterized Method.

 Formal Arguments:- Variable creates inside the method is known as Formal Arguments.
 Actual Arguments:- Data passed inside methood calling statements is known as Actual Arguments.
